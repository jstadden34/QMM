*I created my table in Excel and included it as an image. It can be seen in my knitted PDF, and I have also included the image in my github.  
  

![table summarizing the outputs](C:\\Users\\jared\\Desktop\\HW8_Table.PNG)  


The FDH and FRH methods produced the same results where all 6 facilities were considered efficient with DEA values of 1.0. Thus, none of them had peers other than themselves and the lambda values were simply weights of 1 on themselves.  
  
The CRS and DRS methods also produced the same results as each other. They found Facilities 1, 2, 3, and 4 to be efficient. However, they found Facility 5 to be 98% efficient and Facility 6 to be 87% efficient. Facility 5 had peers in facilities 1, 2, and 4 with relative weights 0.20, 0.80, and 0.54, respectively. Likewise, Facility 6 had peers in facilities 1, 2, and 4, as well, but with relative weights 0.34, 0.39, and 0.13, respectively.  
  
Similarly, the VRS and IRS methods had the same outputs as one another. They found Facilities 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 to be efficient, but Facility 6 to only be 90% efficient. Facility 6 had peers in facilities 1, 2, and 5 with respective relative weights of 0.40, 0.34, and 0.26.
