Question 1:  
Y1P – Y1M = 6X1 + 4X2 + 5X3 - 50  
Y2P – Y2M = 8X1 + 7X2 + 5X3 - 75  
P = 20X1 + 15X2 + 25X3  

Question 2:  
Max: Z = P – 6C – 3D = 20X1 + 15X2 + 25X3 – 6Y1P – 6Y1M – 3Y2M  

Question 3:
```{r}
library(lpSolveAPI)
gp <- read.lp("jstadden_9.lp")
gp
```

```{r}
solve(gp)
get.objective(gp)
get.variables(gp)
```

Findings:  
X1 = 0, X2 = 0, X3 = 15  
Y1P = 25, Y1M = 0  
Y2P = 0, Y2M = 0  
    
This suggests Product 3 should have a production rate of 15.  
Also, we are over the employment goal by 25 (2500 emplyees).  
The penalty from exceeding the goal is 225.
